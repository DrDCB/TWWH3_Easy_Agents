# Easy Agents
A mod for Total War Warhammer III. Gives the player a cap of 100 per agent type for their faction, and allows recruitment in every province. Doesn't affect the AI.

N.B. Kislev's Frost Maidens still require training through the Ice Court mechanic.

Since the horde armies of Nakai and the Vampire Coast can't make use of the database table additions (can't include both settled and horde effects), they now get additional scripted effect bundles for their horde armies.

Consider this a spiritual successor to [Adventuring Party All-In-One](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1190120227) for WH2 by Lars.

IMMORTAL EMPIRES UPDATE NOTICE:
I have updated the mod to include the WH1 and 2 races for IE. I have done some cursory tests, but it's impractical for me to test every single race (not least because I don't own all the DLC, including the new Chaos DLC), so it is possible I may have missed some specific agent type. Please let me know if that's the case.

Mod originally uploaded to the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790226923). Releases added here to support other platforms.
